<p><span class="smcap">The slick</span> black car sped along
the wide and straight street. It
came to a smooth stop in front of
a clean white house. A man got
out of the car and walked briskly
to the door. Reaching out with a
pink hand, he pressed the doorbell
with one well-manicured finger.</p>

<p>The door was answered by a
housewife. She was wearing a
white blouse, a green skirt and a
green apron trimmed with white.
Her feet were tucked into orange
slippers, her blonde hair was done
up in a neat bun. She was dressed
as the government had ordered
for that week.</p>

<p>The man said, "You are Mrs.
Christopher Nest?"</p>

<p>There was a trace of anxiety in
her voice as she answered. "Yes.
And you are...?"</p>

<p>"My name is Maxwell Hanstark.
As you may already know, I
am the official psychiatrist for this
district. My appointment will last
until the end of this year."</p>

<p>Mrs. Nest invited him in. They
stepped into a clean living-room.
At one end was the television set,
at the other end were several
chairs. There was nothing between
the set and the chairs except
a large grey rug which
stretched from wall to wall. They
walked to the chairs and sat down.</p>

<p>"Now, just what is the matter
with your husband, Mrs. Nest?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Nest reached into a large
bowl and absently picked up a
piece of stale popcorn. She daintily
placed it in her mouth and
chewed thoughtfully before she
answered.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew. All he does all
day long is sit in the backyard and
stare at the grass. He insists that
he is standing on top of a cliff."</p>

<p>Hanstark took out a small
pad and a short ball-point pen.
He wrote something down before
he spoke again. "Is he violent?
Did he get angry when you told
him there was no cliff?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Nest was silent for a moment.
A second piece of popcorn
joined the first. Hanstark's pen
was poised above the pad. "No.
He didn't get violent."</p>

<p>Hanstark wrote as he asked the
next question. "Just what <i>was</i> his
reaction?"</p>

<p>"He said <i>I</i> must be crazy."</p>

<p>"Were those his exact words?"</p>

<p>"No. He said that I was"&mdash; She
thought for a moment&mdash;"loco.
Yes, that was the word."</p>

<p>"Loco?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He said it just like those
cowboys on the television."</p>

<p>Hanstark looked puzzled. "Perhaps
you had better tell me
more about this. When did he
first start acting this way?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Nest glanced up at the
television set, then back at Hanstark.
"It was right after Texas
Week. You remember&mdash;they
showed all of those old cowboy
pictures."</p>

<p>Hanstark nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, he stayed up every night
watching them. Some nights he
didn't even go to sleep. Even
after the set was off, he sat in one
of the chairs, just staring at the
screen. This morning, when I got
up, he wasn't in the house. I
looked all over but I couldn't find
him. I was just about ready to
phone the police when I glanced
out the window into the backyard.
And I saw him."</p>

<p>"What was he doing?"</p>

<p>"He was just sitting there in the
middle of the yard, staring. I
went out and tried to bring him
into the house. He told me he
had to watch for someone. When
I asked him what he was talking
about he told me that I was crazy.
That was when I phoned you,
Mr. Hanstark."</p>

<p>"A very wise move, Mrs. Nest.
And would you show me where
your husband is right now?"</p>

<p>She nodded her head and they
both got up from the chairs. They
walked through the dining-room
and kitchen. On the back porch
Hanstark came to a halt.</p>

<p>"You'd better stay here, Mrs.
Nest." He walked to the door
and opened it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hanstark," Mrs. Nest
called.</p>

<p>Hanstark turned and saw her
standing next to the automatic
washing machine. "Yes?"</p>

<p>"Please be careful."</p>

<p>Hanstark smiled. "I shall be,
Mrs. Nest."</p>

<p>He walked out the door and
down three concrete steps. Looking
a little to his right, he saw a
man squatted on his heels. He
walked up to the man. "You are
Mr. Christopher Nest?"</p>

<p>The man looked up and stared
for a moment at Hanstark.
"Yep," he answered. Then he
turned and stared at the grass
again.</p>

<p>"And may I ask you what you
are doing?"</p>

<p>Nest answered without looking
up. "Guardin' the pass."</p>

<p>Hanstark scribbled something
in his notebook. "And why are
you guarding the pass?"</p>

<p>Nest rose to his feet and stared
down at Hanstark. "Just what are
you askin' all of these questions
for, stranger?"</p>

<p>Hanstark saw Nest was bigger
than he and decided to play along
for a while. After all, strategy ...</p>

<p>"I'm just interested in your
welfare, Mr. Nest."</p>

<p>Nest shrugged his shoulders.
He reached into his shirt pocket
and pulled out a sack of tobacco
and some paper. Holding a piece
of paper in one hand, he carefully
poured a little tobacco onto it. In
one quick movement he rolled the
paper and tobacco into a perfect
cylinder.</p>

<p>He put the sack of tobacco and
paper back into his pocket and
took out a wooden kitchen match.
He scraped it to life on the sole
of his shoe and applied the flame
to the tip of the cigarette. He
puffed it into life and threw the
match away. It burned for a few
moments in the moist grass, then
went out. A thin trail of smoke
rose from it, and then was gone.</p>

<p>"Why are you guarding the
pass?" Hanstark asked again.</p>

<p>Nest resumed his crouch on the
grass. "News is around that Dirty
Dan the cattle rustler is gonna try
to steal some of my cattle." He
patted an imaginary holster at his
side. "And I aim to stop him."</p>

<p>Hanstark thought for a moment.
Strategy&mdash;he must use
strategy ... "Mr. Nest." He
waited until Nest had turned to
him. "Mr. Nest. What would you
say if I told you that there was no
pass down there?"</p>

<p>"Why shucks, pardner. I'd say
you'd been chewin' some loco
weed."</p>

<p>"And if I could prove it?"</p>

<p>Nest answered after a moment's
pause. "Why then, I guess
<i>I'd</i> be loco."</p>

<p>Hanstark thought it was going
to be easy. "Mr. Nest, it is a well
known fact that no one can walk
in mid-air. Is that not true?"</p>

<p>Nest took a deep drag on his
cigarette and blew the smoke out
of his nostrils. "Shore."</p>

<p>"Then if I were to walk out
above your pass you'd have to admit
there is no pass."</p>

<p>"Reckon so."</p>

<p>Hanstark began to walk in the
direction of Nest's "cliff." Nest
jumped to his feet and grabbed
the official psychiatrist by the arm.</p>

<p>"What're you tryin' to do,"
Nest said angrily, "kill yourself?"</p>

<p>Hanstark shook free of his
grasp. "Mr. Nest, I am not going
to kill myself. I am merely going
to walk in that direction." He
pointed to where the cliff was supposed
to be. "To you it will look
as if I were walking in mid-air."</p>

<p>Nest dropped his hands to his
sides. "Shucks, I don't care if you
kill yourself. It's just that it's
liable to make the cattle nervous."</p>

<p>Hanstark gave him a cold glare
and began to walk. He took three
paces and stopped. "You see,
Mr. Nest. There is no cliff."</p>

<p>Nest looked at him and laughed.
"You just take one more step
and you'll find there <i>is</i> a cliff!"</p>

<p>Hanstark took another step&mdash;a
long one. His face bore a surprised
look as he disappeared
beneath the grass. His screams
could be heard for a moment before
he landed on the rocks below.</p>

<p>Nest walked to the edge of the
cliff and looked down at the mangled
body. He took off his hat in
respect. "Little feller had a lotta
guts." Then he added, "Poor
little feller."</p>

<p>He put his hat back on and
looked down at the entrance to
the valley. A horse and rider appeared
from behind several rocks.</p>

<p>"Dirty Dan!" Nest exclaimed.
He reached down and picked up
his rifle.</p>
